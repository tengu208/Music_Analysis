### **Research Questions & Conclusions drawn from data analysis**

1. How does the data on music preference compare to Billboards?
    - According to the data, Rock and Pop music are the most popular music generes, with 31.6% and 24.5%, respectively.
    - Billbooard ranks Pop and HipHop as the most popular, with 39% and 35%, respectively.
    - It is interesting to see Rock lead the data as the most popular, however this might take into account the limited data set.
    
    
2. Does a person's preference for Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music differ based on their gender?
    - Overall, females prefer the generes of Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno more than males. The only excpetion is for Techno, where males and females prefer the genre about the same. 
    - Males dislike Latino music the most, while females dislike Techno the most.
    - Both males and females prefer Rock the most, out of the parameters I set.
    - Based on this data, I think it is interesting that males and females have the same music preference.


3. Does a person's preference for Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music differ based on their age?
    - 19 to 25 year olds prefer Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music to any other age group (15-19, 25-30)
    - 25 to 30 years olds prefer these genres the least.
    - The preference for these upbeat music genres seems appropriate for 19 to 25 year olds, as this is the time where many individuals in this age bracket attend large social gatherings. 


4. Can a person's preference for Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music determine their preference for Action, Animated, SciFi, Romantic, Comedy movies?
    - The highest correlation is between Latino music and Romantic movies, with a correlation of 0.314.
    - The second highest correlation is between Pop music and Romantic movies, with a correlation of 0.312.
    - These results indicate that the advertising of movies to people should not matter based on their music taste
    - Due to the low correlations found in my research, I would not deploy my results for the reationship between Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music and Action, Animated, SciFi, Romantic, Comedy movies because they are not statistically significant. 
    
  
5. Can a person's spending habits influence their preference for Action, Animated, SciFi, Romantic, Comedy movies?
    - The group had originally hypothesized that entertainment spending and HipHop/Rap, Pop music would have a large correlation.
    - The highest correlation found is between shopping at shopping centers (ie: target and wallmart)and Pop music, with a correlation of 0.28.
    - Based on the data and the low correlations, my hypothesis was not supported and I would not deploy my results for this correlation.
    - These results indicate that the advertising of movies to people should not matter based on their spending habits.


6. Can a person's living environment effect their preference for Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music?
    - Individuals living in the city prefer Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music more than those living in a village. 
    - This correlation seems acceptable due to cities typically having greater access to music and night life. 


In the next iteration of resarch I would ask spotify to provude us with data on: premium vs non premim, areas of the world that stream spotify the most, what time of day music is streamed (computer vs mobile devices)


### **Expanding on Research Questions**
**Focusing on the UK Market**---demographics, music/ movie preferences, spending habits. 
1. **Is there a connection between demographics and listening to certain music?**
    - looking at how age and gender can effect the types of music listened to
    - narrow music generes: Spotify lists Pop, EDM, HipHop, Latin as the most popular generes: https://www.displayr.com/most-popular-music/
    - from data: Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin, Techno/Trance
    - bar graph/ scatter plot
    

2. **Is there a connection between music and movie preferences?**

    - UK info on most popular moves: Action, Anamation, SciFi, Drama, Comedy: https://www.statista.com/statistics/296656/film-genres-ranked-by-box-office-gross-in-the-uk/
    - from data: Action movies, Animated, SciFi, Romantic, Comedy
    - from data: Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin, Techno/Trance
    - bar graph/ scatter plot
       

3. **Does music taste effect spending/saving habits? What do people spend their money on?**
    - from data: partying/socializing, go to large shopping centers, gadgets, save all the money you can, spending on looks
    - from data: Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin, Techno/Trance


**Anticipated Challenges**
1. Combing through the data-- data is coded through 1-5 system
2. Determining the best way to represent/display these outcomes


**Results Expected to Present**
I expect that the type of music a person listens to will explain more about them. While I expect to see certain patters of behavior, such as a correlation between a person's movie preference and preferred genre of music, I also anticipate to come across some surprises that may not fit the stereotypical ideals.
